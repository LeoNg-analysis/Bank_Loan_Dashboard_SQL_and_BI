📊 Bank Loan Performance Dashboard
🧩 Overview

This project analyzes a bank’s loan portfolio using SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for visualization. The report provides a comprehensive overview of loan applications, approvals, repayments, and risk patterns, helping decision-makers monitor financial performance and credit risk in real time.

🧠 Business Application

The dashboard can be applied in banking and financial management to:

Monitor key KPIs such as total funded amount, loan applications, approval rates, and repayment status.

Identify risk trends by analyzing borrower credit grades, default rates, and regional performance.

Improve decision-making by comparing month-over-month (MoM) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) changes in loan disbursements and recoveries.

Optimize loan strategies by targeting high-performing segments and reducing exposure to high-risk borrowers.

Support management reporting with visual summaries for executives and compliance teams.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server: for querying and cleaning raw bank loan data.

Power BI Desktop: for building interactive dashboards, DAX calculations, and data modeling.

📈 Key Insights

The total funded loan amount and approval rate provide a quick snapshot of business performance.

MTD (Month-to-Date) and PMTD comparisons show growth or decline trends in lending activities.

Segmentation by state, purpose, and credit grade allows deeper insight into loan distribution and risk exposure.
